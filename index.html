   <p><span class="squiggle">1</span> Participants from Moscow will be selected through this open call.<br><br><span class="squiggle">2</span> The Gerrit Rietveld Academie is an international university of applied sciences for Fine Arts and Design in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Its graphic design course is world renowned for its innovative and international program, with many of the most prominent figures in contemporary graphic design having graduated from the Rietveld Academie. The course aims to educate graphic designers who can contribute to the development of the discipline, that are prepared to use their work to engage in debate, adopt an investigative and reflective approach to media, find an own method of working, and can express themselves in their own visual language.<br><br><span class="squiggle">3</span> The MMOMA Education Center on 17 Ermolaevsky Lane was opened in the winter 2017 on the one of the four venues of the Moscow Museum of Modern Art. MMOMA Education Center is a platform for self-education, creative and social initiatives and academic research. Its aim is to contribute to the integration of wide social groups into the cultural life. The center supports young art as well as innovative creative initiatives in the fields of science, history, philosophy and literature.<br><br><span class="squiggle">4</span> Workshop groups will be guided by <a href="http://arbeitskollektiv.ru/aga/">Natasha Agapova</a> (RU), <a href="http://bartdebaets.nl/">Bart de Baets</a> (NL), <a href="https://ermolaeva.co/">Tanya Ermolaeva</a> (RU), <a href="http://writtenrecords.info/index.html">Paul Gangloff</a> (FR), <a href="http://typefaces.temporarystate.net/preview/">Roman Gornitsky</a> (RU) and <a href="http://elisabethklement.com//">Elisabeth Klement</a> (EE). <br><br><span class="squiggle">5</span> The title of the workshop is inspired by a personal account of Russian artist Ariadna Arendt’s (1906-1970) time studying at the Vkhutemas, Russia’s revolutionary state art school of the 1920s, and following its abrupt dissolution in 1930 at INPII – the Institute of Proletarian Fine Art. The account has an objectivity – or distance that only reflection might allow – that describes a seemingly absurdist sequence of events related to political, ideological and structural change in an art school. From a today’s perspective it reads as a completely relatable account about what it means (and feels like) studying art and design in an institution. The text can be read <a href="https://www.colta.ru/articles/art/19850-steklyannyy-sovsluzhaschiy-i-opportunist-v-keramike">here</a> (in Russian). An English translation is available <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/182810lq_p-xesMgSGWnX1aB53nbG3F5-/view">here</a>.<br><br><span class="squiggle">6</span> To apply for ‘We begin with a squiggle’ please write a motivation letter (no more that 300 words) about:1.
